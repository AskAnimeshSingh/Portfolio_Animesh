				<h1>Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: Revolutionizing the Future</h1>
				<p>
					Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in the healthcare sektor,
					offering unprecedented opportunities to improve patient care, enhance operational efficiency,
					and accelerate medical research. From diagnosing diseases to personalizing treatment plans,
					AI is reshaping the way healthcare professionals operate and interact with patients.
				</p>

				<h2>1. Enhancing Diagnostics with AI</h2>
				<p>
					One of the most promising applications of AI in healthcare is its ability to assist in
					diagnosing diseases with remarkable accuracy. Machine learning algorithms, trained on vast
					datasets of medical images and patient records, can now detect conditions like cancer, heart
					disease, and neurological disorders often faster and more accurately than human specialists.
					For instance, AI-powered tools like Google's DeepMind have shown the ability to identify
					eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy by analyzing retinal scans with precision
					comparable to top ophthalmologists.
